# Project's Workflow

<!-- #region -->
0. *Multiclass Classification Problems*


1. *Model Architecture* (2 dense layers, (softmax activation func + cross entropy loss func-------> categorical cross entropy loss) [categorical cross entropy explanation](https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/)


2. *Data Normalization* (important feature! Without it training cannot be implemented)


    * Why is it important?
    
    * What types of data normalization exist?
    
    * Which type is adequate for the type of problem I try to solve?
    
    * How can I implement them?
    
    
3. *Pick Adequate Evaluation Metric*

    
    * Accuracy
    
    * Precision
    
    * Recall (Cancer example dont want to miss someone that has cancer at any cost)
    
    * F1 (some intermediary solution of precision and recall)

For each component in the above workflow use the why --> what --> how thought process!


1. **why** is the exact component needed, namely *why is it useful*?


2. **what** is the functionality of the component, namely *what does it actually do?* + (formulate its functionality with math)


3. **how** to implement the component's functionality, namely *how can you sculpture its math formulation?* (translate math to something tangible)
